<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p> Tennis is a popular racquet sport that can be played with 1 per person per team or 2 people per team. Tennis is played with a racquet with strings and a rubber ball and the objective is to force your opponent to miss. It is played on a court with a net in between the two sides. Tennis appeared in the 1800s when it was known as lawn tennis and it was inspired from "real tennis" which is a completly different sport. Nowadays, tennis is played worldwide and can be played on a hard, clay or grass court. </p>

<h2> Basic Rules </h2>
  <p> Most Professional tennis matches are best of 3 sets (exceptions are Men's Grand Slams) which means a player needs to win two sets to win a match. To win a set you need to win 6 games but if both players win 5 games then one needs to win 7 games to win a set. When the score of games is 6-6 a tiebreak will be played, to win a tiebreak one needs to win 7 points and win by a margin of at least two points. To win a game a player needs to win at least 4 points and have at least 2 more points than their opponent. To score a point a player needs to either hit the ball in the court so that their opponent doesn't reach it before two bounces, their opponent hits the ball out, or their opponent hits the ball into the net. </p>
  <p> These are just a few basic rules that don't even scratch the surface. To get into more specifics you can click <a href="https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/tennis.html">here</a>. </p>
  <h2> Professional Tennis </h2> 
  <p> Top level professional tennis is organized by the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and the WTA (Women's Tennis Association). At the top level there are 4 categories of tournaments, in order of importance they are; The Four Grand Slams, Masters 1000s, ATP/WTA 500s and ATP/WTA250s, which are hosted worldwide. Lower level professional tennis is organized by the ITF (International Tennis Federation) with many different tournaments. 
  <p> The past decade or so Men's Tennis has been dominated by the "Big Four" : Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. You can tell just how great they are from the records they hold, Federer and Nadal share the record for most Grand Slam Titles, Federer has the most weeks being ranked at World Number 1, Djokovic is the only one to ever win ever Masters 100 at least once, the list goes on. Other top Men's players of this generation include Stan Wawrinka, Grigor Dmitrov and Juan Martin del Potro. As this generation of players approach retirement many new stars have begun to challenge them. These include the likes of Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Dominic Thiem.
    <p> Recent Women's Tenis has seen the dominance of Serena Williams with other players like Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka, living in her shadow. In the past 5 or so years more female players have stepped up like Simona Halep, the Pliskova sisters, etc. The past 2 years of women's tennis has been a mess, as the old legends age a large range of new challengers compete to take their place. Tons of new players rose to the top like Naomi Osaka, Ashleigh Barty and players came out of nowhere to win Grandslams like the aforementioned two, Sofia Kenin, Iga Świątek and many others. If the average tennis fan took a break from watching tennis for the past couple years, they probably would not recognize any names of the Top 10 players and just a few in the Top 20. As the tour continues, there still isn't a clear front runner or front runners in the race to be the best of the best of the new generation. </p>
  <p>  I haven't even discussed professional Doubles which includes, men's doubles, women's doubles and mixed doubles. To learn more about the men's professional tour click <a href="https://www.atptour.com/">here</a> and for women's click <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/">here</a>. </p>
